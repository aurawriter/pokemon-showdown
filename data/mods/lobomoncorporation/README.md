Lobomon Corporation: Face the Fear, Make the Future
====================
Introduction
------------
Lobotomy Corporation is an indie horror rogue-lite strategy management simulation game developed by Korean studio PROJECT MOON, where you manage and collect energy from Abnormalities. This mod hopes to capture the feel of some of the Abnormalities as Pokemon that you can have fight each other.

Frostbite
------------
Frostbite was implemented almost entirely because originally The Snow Queen's signature move, "Freezing Kiss" was going to be a 50 Accuracy move that Froze the target. In other words, potentially at least _annoying_ to deal with in terms of a metagame. So instead, I implemented Frosbite to make Freezing Kiss just a Frosbite Will-O-Wisp clone.
